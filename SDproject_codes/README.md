- checked_conjectures_30apr contains scripts which were used to identify "regimes". these scripts sample elements of the "v set" and check certain conjectured majorization relations
- bipartitions_oct23 does has something similar to checked_conjectures_30apr, but specialized to the special case of bipartitions of the relevant hilbert space (rather than more general multipartitions)
- more_ineq_nov23 builds on bipartitions_oct23. It contains code providing evidence that, as expected, the "thompson inequalities" (https://doi.org/10.1016/0375-9601(85)90622-X) do not imply the majorization relation which Kaustav's conjecture boils down to

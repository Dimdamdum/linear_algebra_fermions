This folder contains various scripts which study some properties of two integer-valued functions of three natural variables. The achieved goal was to prove (analytically) that these two functions have strictly positive values, other than for certain (few) input 3-tuples.

functions. py contains the definition of the two functions g_B and g_f.

general_bosons.py and general_fermions.py show numerically that the conjectures g_B > 0 and g_f > 0 hold.

sanity_checks_fermions.py check that g_B $\leq$ 0 and g_f $\leq$ 0 for specific input values which are known "exceptions" to the conjecture.

plotting_several_lists.py, understanding_g_B.py and understanding_g_F.py were used to gain some intuition on certain "cuts" of the plots of the two functions.

# linear_algebra_fermions

Here I am storing scripts I used to check various properties of matrices related to my work on fermionic correlations. These scripts are mainly one-use scripts, so readability is far from optimized!

Methods include:
- bounds on eigenvalues on submatrices of Hermitian matrices
- various optimization tasks over matrices in U(d)
